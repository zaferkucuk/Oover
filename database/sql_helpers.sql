-- Usage: SELECT * FROM v_country_summary WHERE is_active = TRUE ORDER BY match_count DESC;


-- ============================================================================
-- NOTES & BEST PRACTICES
-- ============================================================================

/*
PERFORMANCE TIPS:
1. Always use country_id for joins, not country name
2. Add WHERE is_active = TRUE filters to queries
3. Use indexes: idx_countries_code, idx_countries_is_active
4. Consider caching the countries list in application layer

MIGRATION STRATEGY:
1. Run Section 5 queries in order
2. Verify results after each step
3. Keep old 'country' fields until migration is complete
4. Remove deprecated fields in next major version

SECURITY REMINDERS:
1. Enable RLS on countries table before production
2. Limit write access to admin users only
3. Audit country modifications
4. Validate country codes against ISO standards

COMMON ISSUES:
- Orphaned leagues: Run Query 1.2 to identify
- Duplicate codes: Run Query 1.3 to check
- Invalid references: Run Query 1.4 to find
- Migration gaps: Run Query 5.5 to monitor progress
